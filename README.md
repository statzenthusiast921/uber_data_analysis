# Uber Data Analysis

### Description

The purpose of this project was to:
- analyze my spending habits
- understand which restaurants and cuisines I prefer
- how have the prices of my favorite dishes changed over time


### Data

The data used for this analysis was downloaded using the link [here](https://help.uber.com/driving-and-delivering/article/download-your-personal-uber-data?nodeId=fbf08e68-65ba-456b-9bc6-1369eb9d2c44).


### Challenges
- A significant portion of the data wouldn't download properly so I had to copy and paste the data and write a few scripts to manually standardize the formatting to align with the portion that did download.
- The time zones were not standardized evenly for both the eats and rides datasets.  I had to cross check these values to ensure the dates and times were comparable across all datasets.  This involved moving some order times backwards or forwards a few hours depending on the specific inconsistency and sometimes moving a date backwards if the time creeped into the next day.
